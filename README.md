# Bookstore
Project for Databases class where I designed and improved on a typical university bookstore site.

The first phase of the project was to create a relational model for an original concept for an application for a database project.

The second phase was to create an ER diagram using MySQL Workbench with at least five entities, multiple attributes of different types, three different types of relationships, constraints, and triggers. This is at "server/bookstore.mwb".

The third phase was to forward engineer the generating SQL script and write SQL code to test the triggers, insert data, and interact with the database. Some of these can be seen at "server/bookstore_create.sql" and "server/import_data.sql". The import data script was generated by a simple C++ script I wrote.

The final phase was to make a front-end focusing on PHP. I designed a (rather simple) user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and a bit of Ajax.
